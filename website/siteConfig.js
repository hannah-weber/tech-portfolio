    tagline: 'Hi my name is Hannah Weber, I am a second year Computer Science major at Northeastern University. I am concentrating in Artificial Intelligence with an focus in Machine Learning and Data Science, and minoring in Math. \n I chose to study Computer Science because of my curiosity for math, but coming into college I was unsure of what exactly I wanted to do with my degree or what I would concentrate in. Through my coursework I have found I most enjoy subject in Computer Science which intersect with or rely heavily on mathematical concepts and reasoning. One of my favorite courses I have taken thus far has been Mathematics of Data Models. This course outlined key Linear Algebra and Statistical concepts, and presented ways in which they are used process and analyze data. Through several coding projects done in Python (a couple can be found in the above Projects tab), we learned how such principles could be utilized in real-world applications such as storage minimization and data classification. \n  First introduced to the topic in the Tech and Human Values philosophy course I took my freshman year,  I am also fascinated with the many ethical and privacy questions that come about in the technology field, and hope to explore this curiosity in whatever I do.  \n I am currently in search of a 6-month co- op which would allow me to explore these curiosities further. This is my online technical portfolio, please feel free to explore and find out a little bit more about me and some of my projects.',
