    tagline: 'Hi my name is Hannah Weber, I am a second year Computer Science major at Northeastern University. I am concentrating in Artificial Intelligence with an focus in Machine Learning and Data Science, and minoring in Math. Through my coursework I have found I most enjoy subjects in Computer Science  which intersect with or rely heavily on mathematical concepts and reasoning. I have also developed an interest in technology policy and the ethics of technology. I am currently in search of a 6-month co-op which would hopefully allow me to explore these curiosities further. \n \n Along with taking courses, I am currently working as a Teaching Assistant for Principles of Information Science and part time virtually as a Document Processor in support of a multibillion-dollar civil litigation. Both have given me experience with communication, organization, and have overall improved my work ethic and time management. \n \n I am a motivated worker, who works well with other and thrives in a challenging environment - always willing to learn or try something new. \n \n Feel free to explore this site to find out more about me and view some of my programming projects.',
